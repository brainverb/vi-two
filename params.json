{"name":"vi-two","tagline":"javascript / HTML5 hypervideo framework","body":"# vi-two\r\n*vi-two* is an Javascript framework for interactive videos. The framework consists of core components that can be extended by widgets. A widget encapsulates functionalities regarding spatio temporal events of a video (e.g. hyperlinks, comments, overlays).
